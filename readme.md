# 42 Data Science: Logistic Regression (DSLR)

The goal of this project is to implement a multi-class linear classifier "from scratch" using logistic regression. From scratch here means that we implement our own data statistics tools, feature scaling, cost function, and gradient descient descent algorithm.
